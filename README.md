# CommitSmith

CommitSmith is a VS Code / Cursor extension that will orchestrate AI-assisted commit workflows.  
This workspace currently contains the project scaffolding required to begin building the remaining modules defined in `SPEC.md`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run test:unit
npm run test:config
npm run test:journal
npm run test:git
npm run test:codex
```

To iterate on the extension, launch the VS Code Extension Development Host (`F5`) once dependencies are installed. A placeholder `CommitSmith: Hello World` command is available from the command palette to verify activation.
